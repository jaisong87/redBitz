This project contains code templates for different types of algorithm problems. This should be useful for anyone who is interested in algorithm contests or learning algorithms. I'm planning to add code for
1. Graph problems
2. Number Theory
Please free to fork and conribute to the repo. 
Code would be written in such a manner that it would be very easy to adopt it for programming contests.
